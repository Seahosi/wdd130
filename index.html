            <div>Hello! My name is Siliva Fie'eiki. I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. I enjoy camping, all activities that encompass it, and competitive games. I've served a prostelyting mission in Fortworth, Texas. Fortunately, I met a lovely lady there who was also serving, became great friends, and have now been married for some time now.

It's been a great journey so far, and I'm look to raising my family, building my own estate, living on a self sustainable environment, and eventually serving another mission all with my amazing wife.</div>
